# calie

Calie is a simple calculator project made as part of the Human-Computer Interaction course at NTUA during 2021-2022 in colaboration with Giorgos Mpetzelos (github.com/George-Betz).
The goal of this project was to work as an introduction to flutter and to teach app developing and ui creation concepts (how to make a user friendly product, how to prototype an app, how to take advantage of mobile specific options, etc)
